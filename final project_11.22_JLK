## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r}
maps::map("world", fill=TRUE, col="white", bg="lightblue", ylim=c(-60, 90), mar=c(0,0,0,0))

map.world <- map_data("world")

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

## Wave 8 Analysis

##mean age for everyone
d %>% filter(wave == 8) %>% group_by(gender) %>% summarise(mean_age_by_gender = mean(age))

##mean age for matched couples

d %>% filter(wave == 8 & match == 1) %>% group_by(gender) %>% summarise(mean_age_by_gender = mean(age))



### Proportion of same race;
d %>% filter(wave == 8) %>% group_by(gender) %>% summarise(race = sum(samerace)/length(gender))

d %>% filter(wave == 8 & match == 1) %>% group_by(gender) %>% summarise(race = sum(samerace)/length(gender))


### For every wave
d %>% filter(match == 1) %>% group_by(gender, wave) %>% summarise(mean_age_by_gender = mean(age))

d %>% group_by(gender, wave) %>% summarise(mean_age_by_gender = mean(age))

d %>% filter(match == 1) %>% group_by(wave) %>% summarise(race = sum(samerace)/length(gender))


d %>% group_by(gender, wave) %>% summarise(mean_age_by_gender = mean(age))

d %>% filter(match == 1) %>% group_by(wave) %>% summarise(mean_corr = mean(int_corr))

```


Age difference

```{r}
## Age diff

d <-d %>% mutate(age_diff = abs(age_o-age))

d %>% group_by(age_diff) %>% summarise(des2 = sum(dec_o)/n()) %>% ggplot(aes(x = factor(age_diff), y = des2)) + geom_point() + ylim(0, 1)

## For age diff more than 15, not many obs
d %>% group_by(age_diff) %>% summarise(mat2 = sum(match)/n()) %>% ggplot(aes(x = factor(age_diff), y = mat2)) + geom_point() + ylim(0, 0.5)

d %>% group_by(age_diff) %>% summarise(mat2 = sum(match)/n()) %>% ggplot(aes(x = factor(age_diff), y = mat2)) + geom_point() + ylim(0,0.5)

```



distribution of demographics

```{r}
ggplot() + 
  geom_bar(data = d,
           aes(x = factor(match),fill = factor(samerace)),
           position = "fill")

# exploring wave 3
# as there is a huge difference in the percentage of yes in wave three, we are going to consider this wave more precisely to figure out what 
# the potential reasons are for this gape.
```{r}
d%>%
  filter(dec_o==1, wave==3)%>%
  ggplot(aes(y = age, x=factor(gender)))+
  geom_boxplot()+
  ylim(18,30)

## not a big difference in age in wave 3.
```
# not a big difference in age was there in wave three. Overall importance of race will be considered next as well as the importance of race in
# wave three
